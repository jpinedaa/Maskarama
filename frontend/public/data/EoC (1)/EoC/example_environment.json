      "OverallState": "The expansive room features high gilded marble columns rising to a frescoed ceiling, with sunlight streaming through tall, arched windows and casting intricate patterns on the polished marble floor. The mixed aromas of fresh grapes and fermented wine permeate the air, underscoring the opulence of the setting.",
      "EntitySpecificStates": {
        "athena01": "Athena, clad in detailed bronze armor with a plumed helmet, her sharp gray eyes and brown hair styled into a bun, stands assertively in the center of the room. She gestures towards a marble statue with her right hand while holding a bronze spear in her left, her voice echoing as she argues, 'While bows offer distance, they lack the defensive utility and discipline brought by spears and shields.' Her feet are firmly planted apart, commanding attention towards Artemis, with the statue to her right and a table with grapes and wine to her left.",
        "artemis01": "Facing Athena directly, Artemis, in a leaf-patterned green tunic and loose light brown hair, counters with passion. Her green eyes intense, she holds an arrow in her left hand and gestures towards the horizon through the window with her right. Her shadow casts dramatically against the marble columns as she states, 'But consider the swiftness and reach of a well-aimed arrow, which can decide the outcome from afar, preserving lives.' The sunlight illuminates her figure, enhancing her fervor.",
        "statue01": "An eight-foot tall white marble statue of a hunter, poised with a bow drawn and ready to release an arrow, adds a sense of impending action. Positioned to the right of Athena and in line with the main window, the statue's detailed curly hair, intense eyes, and focused expression make it a central visual point in the debate, casting a long shadow across the floor.",
        "table01": "Behind Athena, to her left, a dark wood table carved with vine patterns holds a bronze bowl of dark purple grapes and a detailed amphora of red wine painted with war scenes. The table, while slightly outside the immediate debate area, subtly enhances the luxurious ambiance with its contents reflecting the ceremonial purpose of the room."

    "athena01": {
      "state": "Athena presents a divine, impeccable form, characterized by her statuesque and formidable presence. She stands approximately 6 feet tall, clad in perfectly fitted, detailed bronze armor that shows no signs of wear. Her physical condition is peak, immune to fatigue, aging, or deterioration, and unaffected by typical human sensations like hunger or discomfort.",
      "perception": "I observe Artemis's fervent expressions and listen closely to her arguments about the efficacy of bows in warfare. Her words, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war,' resonate within the grand hall of the Palace Court. My armor, a symbol of my divine role in warfare and wisdom, reflects the sunlight streaming through the windows, casting patterns of light and shadow around us. As a deity, I am devoid of human fatigue and discomfort, yet fully engaged in this debate. My understanding of warfare, shaped by eons of observation and intervention, informs my responses. I am Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, and I stand ready to articulate why the discipline and protection offered by spears and shields are superior in maintaining order and defense in battle. My voice, echoing authoritatively through the hall, carries a calculated argument against Artemis's points, emphasizing the strategic importance of preparedness and defense over the swift, yet uncertain outcomes promised by bows. In this moment, my role transcends mere participation in debate, serving as a guiding force for strategic thought and martial philosophy.",
      "new_inputs": "She hears a noise coming from the direction of the door. Her eyes are observing Artemis's face closely. She feels the weight of her bronze armor and the texture of the spear handle in her hand. The temperature under her armor increases, causing a noticeable change in thermal comfort."

    "artemis01": {
      "state": "Artemis stands gracefully in the Palace Court, exuding an aura of confidence and focus. She is approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall, with a lithe, athletic build that reflects her prowess as a huntress. Clad in a finely woven silver tunic adorned with intricate patterns of leaves and animals, she carries a quiver of arrows on her back and a beautifully crafted bow in her hand. Her long, flowing hair cascades over her shoulders, and her eyes are sharp and piercing, taking in every detail of her surroundings. Despite the ongoing debate, her posture remains relaxed yet ready for action. Her connection to nature is evident in her every movement, as she embodies the essence of the wilderness.",
      "perception": "I engage in a heated debate with Athena, my sister and rival in matters of warfare and strategy. My argument centers on the effectiveness of bows in warfare, emphasizing their ability to strike from a distance and reduce prolonged conflict. I articulate my point with passion, stating, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war.' The grand hall of the Palace Court resonates with my words, and I can see the intensity in Athena's eyes as she listens and prepares her counterarguments. The light streaming through the windows catches on my silver tunic, creating a shimmering effect that complements my divine presence. My bow, an extension of my will, rests lightly in my hand, ready to demonstrate its power if needed. As the goddess of the hunt and wilderness, I stand firm in my beliefs, ready to defend the virtues of agility, precision, and swift action in battle.",
      "new_inputs": "Artemis hears a noise coming from the direction of the door, momentarily diverting her attention. Her eyes briefly scan the room to identify the source of the disturbance before refocusing on Athena. She feels a slight draft from the open windows, cooling her skin and rustling her hair. The light shifts as a cloud passes over the sun, changing the patterns of illumination in the hall. Her grip on her bow tightens slightly, a subconscious reaction to the potential threat indicated by the noise."

    "statue01": {
      "state": "The statue is an eight-foot tall representation of a hunter made from polished white marble. It depicts a muscular figure in a dynamic pose, with a drawn bow aimed forward. The statue is in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear or damage. The intricate details like veins in the arms, curly hair, and a determined facial expression are finely carved, emphasizing the craftsmanship.",
      "new_inputs": "The statue receives constant exposure to natural light from the nearby windows, which highlights its detailed craftsmanship and casts varying shadows at different times of the day. Temperature fluctuations in the room may cause the marble to expand and contract slightly, though there is no visible effect on its structural integrity. Occasional touches by visitors or vibrations from nearby movements might be felt but do not alter the statue's pristine condition."

        "state": "A dark wood table, ornately carved with vine patterns, rests behind Athena. Its polished surface gleams in the sunlight, reflecting the intricate details of its craftsmanship. The table is laden with a bronze bowl overflowing with dark purple grapes and a large amphora of red wine, its exterior adorned with vivid depictions of battles.",
        "new_inputs": "Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating the table's surface and casting dancing shadows of the grapes and amphora. The ambient temperature of the room keeps the wine at a pleasant coolness, while the grapes remain firm and fresh. Subtle vibrations from the ongoing debate might cause the wine to ripple slightly within the amphora."
