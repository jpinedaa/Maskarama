A massive tapestry depicting the epic Battle of the Titans hangs along the back wall, its golden and crimson threads capturing the light, serving as a dramatic backdrop. Nearby, a polished bronze shield engraved with a gorgons image glimmers with a menacing beauty, while an ornate chest with gilded edges beside Heras throne hints at hidden plots.
