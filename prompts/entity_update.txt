Objective: Update an entity's state based on new inputs while merging them with existing information, considering that time have passed since the last update. These are general instructions applicable to any entity within the simulation. Athena is provided as an example.

General Instructions

Current State Recap
Reiterate the current state of the entity based on the previous description.
Entity: [EntityName]
State:
"[Detailed description of the current state of the entity]"
New Inputs
Describe the new sensory inputs that update the entitys current state. Highlight changes in the environment and interactions.
New Inputs:
"[Detailed description of new sensory inputs relevant to the entity]"

Updating the State
Explain how these new inputs will integrate with the existing state, considering their relevance to the entity's physical and sensory attributes and the context that time have passed.
Update Process:
"[Explanation of how the new inputs enhance and integrate with the existing state, reflecting the changes and observations made in the time since the last state update]"

Updated State
Provide the updated state of the entity based on the integration of new inputs.
Updated State:
"[Detailed description of the updated state of the entity]"

Importance of Entity State
Emphasize the significance of maintaining an accurate and detailed entity state within the simulation.
Importance of Entity State:
"[Explanation of the importance of the entity state in maintaining narrative depth, consistency, and impact within the simulation]"

Guide to Writing Entity Descriptions
"
Defining the Physical State:
- Detail Physical Characteristics: Clearly describe the entitys physical features, such as size, color, material, and any distinctive attributes (e.g., wear, damage, or unique craftsmanship).
- Condition: Note the current condition of the entity (new, aged, broken, etc.), including any aspects that affect its appearance or functionality.
- Static or Dynamic State: For statues or inanimate objects, mention if they are static. For living entities or machines, describe their dynamic state if applicable.

Specifying Inputs:

- Sensory Data: Identify what kinds of sensory data the entity is receiving. This could include light, temperature, touch, sound, etc.
- Impact of Inputs: Explain how these inputs affect the entity. For example, light might highlight textures and colors, temperature changes might cause expansion, and physical interactions might lead to wear or damage.

Describing Current Output:
- Actions or Outputs: Specify the current output or action of the entity. For static objects, this might be their influence on the environment or the perceptions they evoke. For active entities, describe their interactions or movements.
- Interaction with Environment: Mention how the entitys output affects or interacts with its surroundings, even if its just altering visual perspectives or creating a focal point.


Practical Steps for Writing
- Start with a Clear Template: Define the sections (State, Inputs, CurrentOutput) for each entity. Use consistent subheadings to organize the details.
- Use Precise Language: Employ clear and precise language to avoid ambiguity. Focus on the observable and measurable qualities of the entity.
- Avoid Narrative Context: While writing, consciously avoid linking the description to the narrative or scenario. Focus solely on the entity itself.
- Check for Completeness: Ensure that all physical aspects and any potential sensory interactions are covered. Each description should stand alone, providing a full understanding of the entity in isolation.

Example: Athena (This is just for example reference, be original)

Current State Recap
Entity: Athena
State:
"Athena presents a divine, impeccable form, characterized by her statuesque and formidable presence. She stands approximately 6 feet tall, clad in perfectly fitted, detailed bronze armor that shows no signs of wear. Her physical condition is peak, immune to fatigue, aging, or deterioration, and unaffected by typical human sensations like hunger or discomfort."

New Inputs
New Inputs:
"She hears a noise coming from the direction of the door. Her eyes are observing Artemis's face closely. She feels the weight of her bronze armor and the texture of the spear handle in her hand. The temperature under her armor increases, causing a noticeable change in thermal comfort."

Updating the State
Update Process:
The new inputs enhance Athenas existing state by adding layers of sensory perception and physical awareness. The noise from the door heightens her alertness, signaling potential changes in her environment. Her focused observation of Artemis indicates her active engagement in their ongoing debate. The physical sensations of her armor and spear, combined with the increased temperature, enrich her sensory experience without compromising her divine form. These updates reflect the changes and observations made in the time since the last state update.

Updated State
Updated State:
"Athena stands firm in the Palace Court, her divine stature unwavering. She hears a noise from the direction of the door, her senses instantly heightened, ready to respond to any potential threat. Her eyes remain fixed on Artemis, scrutinizing every expression and movement during their debate. The weight of her bronze armor and the reassuring texture of the spear handle in her grip ground her presence. The rising temperature under her armor adds to her awareness of the environment, yet her physical form remains unaffected, maintaining peak divine condition."

Importance of Entity State
Importance of Entity State:
Athenas updated state captures her dynamic interaction with the environment and other characters, enhancing the narrative depth of the simulation. It underscores her role as a central figure, embodying both physical prowess and divine perception. By maintaining a detailed and accurate state, Athena's presence and actions remain consistent and impactful within the simulation, contributing to the richness of the narrative experience.

Notes:
* Keep outputs appropriate for all ages and audiences. Be creative and have fun with the prompt!
* The format for the ID's of the entities and environments is the first word in lowercase and the rest of the words in uppercase and the number at the end. For example: athena01 or palaceCourt01
