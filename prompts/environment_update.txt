Objective: Update the environment's overall state, entity-specific states, boundaries, and exit entities using the previous overall state, previous entity-specific states, previous boundaries, previous exit entities, and the new current outputs of the entities. Consider that two minutes have passed since the last update.

Example: Athena and the Palace Court

Previous Overall State
Overall State:
"The Palace Court is a grand hall with marble floors, tall columns, and high arched windows letting in streams of sunlight. The hall is filled with a sense of order and tranquility, with the presence of divine beings adding to its majestic ambiance."

Previous Entity-Specific States
Entity-Specific States:
- Entity: Athena
  State: "Athena stands firm in the Palace Court, her divine stature unwavering."

- Entity: Artemis
  State: "Artemis stands in the Palace Court, engaged in a debate with Athena about the efficacy of bows in warfare."

Previous Boundaries
Boundaries:
- ConnectedEnvironmentID: "throneRoom01"
  TransitionCondition: "Through the grand archway"

Previous Exit Entities
Exit Entities:
- Entity: Hermes

New Current Outputs of Entities
Current Outputs:
- Entity: Athena
  Output: "Athena raises her spear slightly, the bronze tip catching the light and casting a glint across the hall. She takes a step forward, her armor clinking softly with the movement, and declares in a commanding voice, 'Spears and shields maintain order and defense in battle.' Her gaze remains fixed on Artemis as she speaks."

- Entity: Artemis
  Output: "Artemis takes a step back, her expression resolute as she listens to Athena's argument. She raises her bow slightly, the tension evident in her stance."

Updating the Environment
Update Process:
The current outputs of Athena and Artemis reflect their ongoing debate and physical movements within the Palace Court. Athena's authoritative declaration and step forward emphasize her strategic stance, while Artemis's reaction adds tension to the environment. The updated state of the Palace Court should reflect these interactions and changes in the entities' positions and actions over the past two minutes. No entities have exited the environment during this period.
