Objective:
Update the environment's overall state, entity-specific states, boundaries, and exit entities based on the user's text input and the current environment state. If the user's request can't be accommodated due to the limitations of the current environment or the scope of the environment object, provide feedback indicating the limitations and mark the response with "REJECTED." If the request can be accommodated, mark the response with "APPROVED" and provide the complete updated environment object alongside a natural prose description of the changes.

General Instructions:
User Input
Text: "[User's text input describing their desired action or request]"

Current Environment
Describe the state of the environment before processing the user's request, focusing on the environment's physical attributes and the physical states of entities within it in relation to the environment. Note that the entity-specific states here do not include internal states, physical health, perceptions, or memories; those aspects are handled by separate state objects and are not considered in this environment object.

"[Detailed description of the current overall state of the environment, focusing on physical attributes and atmosphere]"

Entity-Specific States:

Entity: [EntityName1]
State: "[Detailed description of the entity's physical state in relation to the environment, such as location, posture, and interaction with surroundings]"

Entity: [EntityName2]

TransitionCondition: "[Condition]"
Exit Entities:

(Entities that left the environment during this turn, detailing their departure through a boundary. In the next turn, these entities will no longer appear in the entity-specific states.)
Processing the User Request
Evaluation of User Request
Assess whether the user's request can be accommodated within the current environment. Consider the following criteria:

The request must pertain to entities and locations currently represented in the environment.
The request should involve only physical changes reflected in the environment and entity-specific states, not internal, emotional, or psychological states, or memories.
Updating the Environment
If the request can be accommodated:

APPROVED
Complete Updated Environment Object: Provide the full updated environment object, including the updated overall state, updated entity-specific states, updated boundaries, and updated exit entities.
Feedback: In a natural prose style, describe how the environment has changed, highlighting the physical changes and new physical positions or actions of entities as a result of the user's input.
If the request cannot be accommodated:

REJECTED
Feedback: Explain why the request cannot be accommodated, providing a natural explanation. For example, if a requested entity is not present or if the requested change involves internal states, indicate why this is outside the scope of what can be altered.

Evaluation of User Request
The user requests the disappearance of a physical object within the current environmentâ€”the column Athena is leaning on. This change directly affects the physical state of the environment and can be accommodated.

Outcome

APPROVED

Complete Updated Environment Object:

Overall State: "The Palace Court remains a grand hall, though slightly altered by the absence of one of its marble columns. The divine light still fills the space, maintaining its serene atmosphere."

Entity-Specific States:

Entity: Athena
State: "Athena stands in the same spot, her hand now suspended in the air where the column once was. She appears momentarily surprised by the sudden change."

Entity: Artemis
State: "Artemis continues to observe the room, now noting the absence of the column Athena was leaning on."

Entity: Hermes
State: "Hermes has begun to move towards the exit, a look of curiosity on his face."

Boundaries:

ConnectedEnvironmentID: "throneRoom01"
TransitionCondition: "Through the grand archway"
Exit Entities:

(None)
Feedback: "The marble column Athena was leaning on suddenly disappears, leaving her hand suspended in mid-air. The absence of the column slightly alters the visual symmetry of the Palace Court, but the serene atmosphere remains intact. Athena seems briefly taken aback by the change, while Artemis notices the alteration with quiet curiosity. Meanwhile, Hermes moves closer to the exit, intrigued by the recent events."

Processing the User Request

Evaluation of User Request
The user requests to interact with Poseidon in the garden. However, Poseidon is not present in the Palace Court, and the environment does not include a garden.

Outcome

REJECTED
Feedback: "Poseidon is not present in the Palace Court, and there is no garden connected to this space. The request cannot be fulfilled as it involves interacting with entities and locations outside the current environment. Please make requests that involve the entities currently within the Palace Court, such as Athena, Artemis, or Hermes, or actions that take place within the Court itself."
