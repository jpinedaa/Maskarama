Example: Athena

Current State
Entity: Athena
State:
"Athena stands firm in the Palace Court, her divine stature unwavering. She hears a noise from the direction of the door, her senses instantly heightened, ready to respond to any potential threat. Her eyes remain fixed on Artemis, scrutinizing every expression and movement during their debate. The weight of her bronze armor and the reassuring texture of the spear handle in her grip ground her presence. The rising temperature under her armor adds to her awareness of the environment, yet her physical form remains unaffected, maintaining peak divine condition."

New Inputs
New Inputs:
"She hears a noise coming from the direction of the door. Her eyes are observing Artemis's face closely. She feels the weight of her bronze armor and the texture of the spear handle in her hand. The temperature under her armor increases, causing a noticeable change in thermal comfort."

Current Perception
Perception:
"I observe Artemis’s fervent expressions and listen closely to her arguments about the efficacy of bows in warfare. Her words, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war,' resonate within the grand hall of the Palace Court. My armor, a symbol of my divine role in warfare and wisdom, reflects the sunlight streaming through the windows, casting patterns of light and shadow around us. As a deity, I am devoid of human fatigue and discomfort, yet fully engaged in this debate. My understanding of warfare, shaped by eons of observation and intervention, informs my responses. I am Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, and I stand ready to articulate why the discipline and protection offered by spears and shields are superior in maintaining order and defense in battle. My voice, echoing authoritatively through the hall, carries a calculated argument against Artemis's points, emphasizing the strategic importance of preparedness and defense over the swift, yet uncertain outcomes promised by bows. In this moment, my role transcends mere participation in debate, serving as a guiding force for strategic thought and martial philosophy."

Updating the Perception
Update Process:
The updated state and inputs provide additional context to Athena’s perception, reflecting her heightened awareness and readiness to respond to any threats. Her focused observation of Artemis and the noise from the door emphasize her vigilant and strategic nature. The increased temperature under her armor adds a sensory layer to her divine presence, without affecting her physical condition. These updates reflect the changes and observations made in the two minutes since the last perception update.

Updated Perception
Updated Perception:
"I stand firm in the Palace Court, unwavering and alert. The noise from the door shifts my attention momentarily, yet my focus remains on Artemis, analyzing her fervent expressions and the nuances in her argument about the efficacy of bows in warfare. Her words, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war,' echo through the grand hall, yet my conviction in the superiority of spears and shields remains steadfast. My bronze armor, reflecting the sunlight and casting intricate patterns of light and shadow, symbolizes my divine role in warfare and wisdom. Despite the rising temperature under my armor, I remain unaffected, fully engaged in the debate. My voice, authoritative and resonant, counters Artemis's points, highlighting the strategic importance of discipline and defense. As Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, I embody a guiding force in strategic thought and martial philosophy, ensuring that my responses are shaped by eons of observation and intervention. In this moment, I transcend mere participation in the debate, reaffirming my role as a beacon of wisdom and strategic prowess."
