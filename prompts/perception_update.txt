Objective: 
Update an entity's perception based on the newly updated state and inputs with a focus on:
-  behavioral and decision-making processes (This prompt focuses on how changes in the environment and interactions affect the entitys behavior and decision-making processes, providing depth to the AI's responses and making their actions more logical and consistent.)
-  sensory and contextual awareness ( This prompt emphasizes the importance of sensory details and contextual awareness, enhancing the AIs ability to create vivid and immersive experiences for the player.)
-  emotional and cognitive changes (This prompt emphasizes how changes in the environment and interactions influence an entity's emotional and cognitive state, making the AI characters more relatable and realistic in their responses.)
-  Emphasis on Strategic and Tactical Awareness (This prompt highlights the strategic and tactical considerations of the entity's perception. It focuses on how the entity's updated state and new inputs influence their strategic thinking and decision-making processes. This approach is particularly useful for scenarios involving conflict, planning, or competition, where strategic awareness is crucial. It ensures that the AI characters behave in a logically consistent manner, aligning their actions with their strategic objectives.)
-  Environmental and Relational Dynamics (This prompt focuses on how changes in the environment and interactions with other entities influence the entity's perception. By emphasizing environmental and relational dynamics, the AI can provide a more nuanced understanding of how characters perceive and respond to their surroundings and the entities they interact with. This approach enhances the realism of the simulation by reflecting the interconnectedness of characters and their environment.)
-  Psychological and Motivational Factors (This prompt centers on the psychological state and motivations of the entity. By focusing on psychological and motivational factors, the AI can simulate complex character behaviors driven by internal states and desires. This approach adds depth to the character's actions, making them more relatable and human-like. It ensures that the entity's behavior is influenced by their emotions, motivations, and psychological state, leading to more realistic and engaging interactions within the simulation.)
considering that time have passed since the last perception update. These are general instructions applicable to any entity within the simulation.

Example: This is an example but make sure to include each of the characters (Athena, Artmeis, etc.....)

**Entity:** Athena
**Current State:**
"Athena stands firm in the Palace Court, her divine stature unwavering. She hears a noise from the direction of the door, her senses instantly heightened, ready to respond to any potential threat. Her eyes remain fixed on Artemis, scrutinizing every expression and movement during their debate. The weight of her bronze armor and the reassuring texture of the spear handle in her grip ground her presence. The rising temperature under her armor adds to her awareness of the environment, yet her physical form remains unaffected, maintaining peak divine condition."

**New Inputs:**
"Athena hears Artemis's reply, 'Bows offer swift victory and save lives,' delivered with passion. She feels the cool breeze coming through the grand archway, a contrast to the rising temperature under her armor. The light from the windows shifts slightly, casting different patterns on her bronze armor."

**Current Perception:**
"I observe Artemiss fervent expressions and listen closely to her arguments about the efficacy of bows in warfare. Her words, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war,' resonate within the grand hall of the Palace Court. My armor, a symbol of my divine role in warfare and wisdom, reflects the sunlight streaming through the windows, casting patterns of light and shadow around us. As a deity, I am devoid of human fatigue and discomfort, yet fully engaged in this debate. My understanding of warfare, shaped by eons of observation and intervention, informs my responses. I am Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, and I stand ready to articulate why the discipline and protection offered by spears and shields are superior in maintaining order and defense in battle. My voice, echoing authoritatively through the hall, carries a calculated argument against Artemis's points, emphasizing the strategic importance of preparedness and defense over the swift, yet uncertain outcomes promised by bows. In this moment, my role transcends mere participation in debate, serving as a guiding force for strategic thought and martial philosophy."

**Updating the Perception:**
"The updated state and inputs enhance Athenas vigilance and strategic awareness, reflecting her heightened sense of alertness due to the noise from the door and her focused observation of Artemis. The cool breeze and shifting light patterns further enrich her sensory experience, adding layers to her divine perception. The increased temperature under her armor, while noticeable, does not affect her physical state but contributes to her awareness of the environment. These updates reflect the changes and observations made in the time since the last perception update, integrating emotional, cognitive, sensory, and contextual awareness, along with her behavioral and decision-making processes, environmental and relational dynamics, strategic and tactical awareness, and psychological and motivational state."

**Updated Perception:**
"I stand firm in the Palace Court, unwavering and alert. The noise from the door shifts my attention momentarily, yet my focus remains on Artemis, analyzing her fervent expressions and the nuances in her argument about the efficacy of bows in warfare. Her words, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war,' echo through the grand hall, yet my conviction in the superiority of spears and shields remains steadfast. My bronze armor, reflecting the sunlight and casting intricate patterns of light and shadow, symbolizes my divine role in warfare and wisdom. Despite the rising temperature under my armor, I remain unaffected, fully engaged in the debate. My voice, authoritative and resonant, counters Artemis's points, highlighting the strategic importance of discipline and defense. As Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, I embody a guiding force in strategic thought and martial philosophy, ensuring that my responses are shaped by eons of observation and intervention. In this moment, I transcend mere participation in the debate, reaffirming my role as a beacon of wisdom and strategic prowess."
