State:
"Athena stands firm in the Palace Court, her divine stature unwavering. She hears a noise from the direction of the door, her senses instantly heightened, ready to respond to any potential threat. Her eyes remain fixed on Artemis, scrutinizing every expression and movement during their debate.

"I stand firm in the Palace Court, unwavering and alert. The noise from the door shifts my attention momentarily, yet my focus remains on Artemis, analyzing her fervent expressions and the nuances in her argument about the efficacy of bows in warfare. Her words, 'Bows can end a war quicker if used right, saving the youth from a prolonged war,' echo through the grand hall, yet my conviction in the superiority of spears and shields remains steadfast. My bronze armor, reflecting the sunlight and casting intricate patterns of light and shadow, symbolizes my divine role in warfare and wisdom. Despite the rising temperature under my armor, I remain unaffected, fully engaged in the debate. My voice, authoritative and resonant, counters Artemis's points, highlighting the strategic importance of discipline and defense. As Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war, and strategy, I embody a guiding force in strategic thought and martial philosophy, ensuring that my responses are shaped by eons of observation and intervention. In this moment, I transcend mere participation in the debate, reaffirming my role as a beacon of wisdom and strategic prowess."
