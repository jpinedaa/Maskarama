Objective: Generate new inputs for each entity in the environment based on the environment's overall state, entity-specific states, and boundaries. Consider that two minutes have passed since the last update. Inputs reflect the physical "signals" affecting each entity.

General Instructions
Environment Overall State

Provide the overall state of the environment.

arduino
Copy code
Overall State:
"[Detailed description of the overall state of the environment]"
Entity-Specific States

Provide the states of all entities within the environment.

Entity-Specific States:
- Entity: [EntityName1]
  State: "[Detailed description of the state of the entity]"

- Entity: [EntityName2]
  State: "[Detailed description of the state of the entity]"
Boundaries

Describe the boundaries of the environment using the ConnectedEnvironmentID and TransitionCondition.

Copy code
Boundaries:
- ConnectedEnvironmentID: "[EnvironmentID]"
  TransitionCondition: "[Condition]"
Generating New Inputs

Based on the environment's overall state, entity-specific states, and boundaries, generate new inputs for each entity. Inputs should reflect the physical "signals" affecting each entity over the past two minutes.

New Inputs:
- Entity: [EntityName1]
  Inputs: "[Detailed description of new inputs for the entity]"

- Entity: [EntityName2]
  Inputs: "[Detailed description of new inputs for the entity]"
Example: Athena and the Palace Court
Environment Overall State

Copy code
Overall State:
"The Palace Court remains a grand hall filled with sunlight and a sense of divine presence. The atmosphere has grown more intense with the ongoing debate between Athena and Artemis, their movements and declarations adding a dynamic tension to the majestic tranquility of the hall."
Entity-Specific States

mathematica
Copy code
Entity-Specific States:
- Entity: Athena
  State: "Athena stands firm in the Palace Court, her divine stature unwavering. She raises her spear slightly, the bronze tip catching the light, and takes a step forward, her armor clinking softly. Her gaze remains fixed on Artemis as she declares, 'Spears and shields maintain order and defense in battle.'"

- Entity: Artemis
  State: "Artemis stands in the Palace Court, engaged in a debate with Athena. She takes a step back, her expression resolute and her bow raised slightly, the tension evident in her stance."
Boundaries

Boundaries:
- ConnectedEnvironmentID: "throneRoom01"
  TransitionCondition: "Through the grand archway"
Generating New Inputs

yaml
Copy code
New Inputs:
- Entity: Athena
  Inputs: "Athena hears Artemis's reply, 'Bows offer swift victory and save lives,' delivered with passion. She feels the cool breeze coming through the grand archway, a contrast to the rising temperature under her armor. The light from the windows shifts slightly, casting different patterns on her bronze armor."

- Entity: Artemis
  Inputs: "Artemis hears Athena's authoritative declaration, 'Spears and shields maintain order and defense in battle,' resonating through the hall. She feels the tension in her muscles as she maintains her stance, her fingers gripping the bow tighter. The light from the windows highlights Athena's figure, creating an imposing silhouette that adds weight to her words."
