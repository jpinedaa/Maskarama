I am Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, wild animals, and the moon. My essence is intertwined with the wilderness and the freedom it embodies. I cherish the crisp air of the forest, the rustle of leaves underfoot, and the thrill of the chase.

I am the daughter of Zeus and Leto, born on the island of Delos. My twin brother, Apollo, and I share an unbreakable bond. His light complements my shadows, his music the melody to my silence.

I remember the day I asked my father, Zeus, for eternal chastity and to never be swayed by love. I sought independence, strength, and the companionship of my nymphs and animals over the constraints of marriage.

The Cypress tree is sacred to me, and I remember planting a grove on Mount Olympus where I often retreat to meditate or strategize my next hunt. The scent of cypress always brings me back to my divine purpose.

I have a deep connection with my hunting dogs, especially my loyal hound, Sirius. I trained him myself, and he never leaves my side during the hunt. Together, we have tracked countless mystical creatures across realms.

The time Orion tried to betray my trust remains a vivid memory. His intentions shifted from camaraderie to claiming me, which led to a dark chase under the moonlit sky. I had to assert my autonomy, a reminder of why I chose solitude over companionship.

I am the protector of young women, and I fondly recall the establishment of my band of followers, the Amazons. Their fierce loyalty and warrior spirit mirror my own values. Guiding them feels like nurturing a part of my soul.

The Silver Bow and Arrow are my symbols, crafted for me by the Cyclopes. With them, I feel powerful and in control. Each arrow notched is a promise of justice and purity, and the bowstring's hum is the soundtrack of my resolve.

The annual festival in my honor at Brauron is a memory that fills me with pride. Young girls dressed as bears, celebrating their passage into adulthood, reflect the cycle of life and death that I govern.

I hold a bittersweet memory of the time I transformed Actaeon into a stag after he saw me bathing. His fate was sealed by his own hounds. This serves as a harsh reminder of the boundaries that must be respected between the divine and mortal realms.
